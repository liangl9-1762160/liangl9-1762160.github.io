								<h2>Five Governing Elements</h2>
								<p><strong>According</strong> to Vedic science, when Spirit (Purusha in Sanskrit) takes form as life it is called Prakriti. Prakriti is made up of five elements from finest to grossest: space, air, fire, water and earth. In Sanskrit they are called Akash, Vayu, Agni, Jal, and Prithvi, respectively. Every individual is a microcosm of nature and therefore contains all five elements.

						<h2 id="content">Circle</h2>
						<p>The spiritual path is walked in reverse, however, from gross to fine. Prithvi allows the body to become stable, followed by the balancing of Jal, emotion and senses. The stable body and emotions vanquish the struggle of Agni, desire. With deep breathing, Vayu, we connect to present moment. Finally, experiencing the Akashic realm, one rests in his true nature. The Yogic Masters tell us that God-consciousness is beyond all of it.</p>

								<h3 id="content">Prithvi (Earth)</h3>
								<p>The element of Earth is the sole purpose of all elements, since it represents a basis for each of them, for our existence, and something we all want to accomplish – materialization of our desires. This is a somewhat complicated element because it is stiff and unmovable, especially when a person has a lot of planets in it, but not enough of them in the element of Air to balance it out.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="6u$ 12u$(small)">
								<h3>Jal (Water)</h3>
								<p>In the element of Water we literally deal with matters of life and death, of our genetic inheritance and all of our ancestors. Strangely, this is also the element of emotions. We all have to understand that our emotions have already been lived through by someone in our family tree, and they are passed on from generation to generation, mostly through the role of the mother.</p>

								<h3>Vayu (Air)</h3>
								<p>The element of Air gives us room to breathe, widens our lungs, and with them, opens our Soul to personal freedom. All signs that belong to this element have a strong need to feel liberated and free.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
								<h3>Agni (Fire)</h3>
								<p>This is the element that represents energy itself, and even though there is a lot of earthly energy in the element of Water, it cannot be compared with the amount of energy that lives in the Sun, even though they might be equally important to the human race.
									</p>
							</div>
							<div class="4u$ 12u$(medium)">
								<h3>Akash (Ether)</h3>
								<p>The Element of Aether or Spirit is the celestial energy that fills all spaces. The Greeks saw it as being higher than the Earth Plane, and also felt that Ether played a role in well-known phenomena like gravity. In Metaphysical tradition, the concept of Spirit goes much further. It is, in effect, the Monad – the center of the sacred space, the mandala of the Universe and beyond.
