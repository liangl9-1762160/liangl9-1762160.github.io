								<h2>How to join us</h2>
								<p> Please send us email for application, including personal information, health statement and the trip you want to join. We will send back email confirmations as soon as possible. The specific destinies will be discussed as we set up a group.
								</p>

                                    <h3>Fee</h3>
                            <p>As you can see, this is not a casual field trip. The fee for any member is not low but actually considerable. We will post specific expenditure table as we figure out the schedule at the destiny. It is not allowed that you confirmed the trip and then you quit because of the cost. So, make up your mind before it comes this far.

						<h2 id="content">Trips</h2>
						<p>We are currently running five sections for exploring trips!</p>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="6u 12u$(small)">
								<h3 id="content">Prithvi (Earth)</h3>
								<p>The element of Earth is the sole purpose of all elements, since it represents a basis for each of them. We will run into great mountains to explore the geology and all kinds of plants.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="6u$ 12u$(small)">
								<h3>Jal (Water)</h3>
								<p>In the element of Water we literally deal with matters of life and death, of our genetic inheritance and all of our ancestors. Let's go and feel the greatest ocean! Watch the most neautiful sunrise and sunset!</p>
							</div>
							<!-- Break -->
							<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
								<h3>Vayu (Air)</h3>
								<p>The element of Air gives us room to breathe, widens our lungs, and with them, opens our Soul to personal freedom. What could be better than parachute to feel the wind and cloud?</p>
							</div>
							<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
								<h3>Agni (Fire)</h3>
								<p>This is the element that represents energy itself, and even though there is a lot of earthly energy in the element of Water, it cannot be compared with the amount of energy that lives in the Sun. Want to exlore fire? A volcano bay would be the best point to start!
									</p>
							</div>
							<div class="4u$ 12u$(medium)">
								<h3>Akash (Ether)</h3>
								<p>The Element of Aether or Spirit is the celestial energy that fills all spaces. The Greeks saw it as being higher than the Earth Plane, and also felt that Ether played a role in well-known phenomena like gravity. We will go and visit world-famous skylab, which is a valuable chance for scientific and technological talents.
